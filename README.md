# Our Pizza

Our Pizza is a local resturant who desired a wesbite where theor customers could request bookings online, and the site manager could access their bookings. Both the customer and site manager needed to be able to:
- Request new bookings
- View all their upcoming pending bookings
- View all their upcoming approved bookings
- Have the ability to edit their bookings
- Have the ability to cancel their bookings 

The Site manager also requested a way to approve pending bookings for customers. 
The website also needed to show new customers what Our Pizza is and what makes it special.

## Design
The design of the wesbite needed to be uncomplicated but bold. This was reflected in the font and colour choices.  The actual design was created in Adobe Illustrator.
